# Terrible App

## TODO

- Restore zone cursor and copy/paste/cut mechanism
- Pressing tab should switch to the script editor for the current universe
  - the script is called every X ticks (currently no clock)
  - the script is tied to that universe and will not be able to play with data from other universes
- Fix InputHandling to prevent a key from running multiple handlers (how?)
